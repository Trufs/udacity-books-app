# MyReads Book App
An app for private library management.

### Prerequisites
Can be used with any browser that supports ES6. Needs npm installed (see Installing).

### Installing
To start the app, run 'npm start' in your terminal. It will take one of the ports and open in your browser.
If you don't have npm installed, run 'npm install' first.

### Instructions
Add books to your library:
Click on the plus sign icon to go to search page. Type your query into the text field (list of possible queries is limited, see [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md) ). A collection of books will be displayed. When you find a book that interests you, click on a green arrow icon to add it to your library. You can choose to store it in one of the categories: "Currently Reading", "Want To Read" or "Read".
Once you added books to your library, they will be displayed on the main page, grouped by categories. You can change the book's category the same way as on the search page or delete it from the library choosing "None".
